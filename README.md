# Arcana Industrialis
**A modpack made by Telthar & Kopyrman**

A minecraft 1.12.2 technic and adventure modpack centered around few technological "ages"

- Start your own industrial revolution with Immersive Engineering and it's addons
- Slowly progress into more technologically advanced machines with Mekanism
- Store your precious items with the aid of computerisation*
- Harness the power of atom and enter the atomic age with NuclearCraft
- Reach the stars with good ol' galacticraft

<sup>*Computerisation in the meaning of *"Refined Storage"*. There are also actual computer mods: OpenComputers and CC: Tweaked. Unfortunately retrocomputers mod caused crashes, so you can't program in FORTH like a real programmer :(</sup>

#### But that's just the "Industrialis" part of the name. This modpack also includes:
- Classic adventure mods like Twilight Forest and Aether
- New ones such as Abyssalcraft
- New dungeons with Ruins Mod and Roguelike Dungeons
- ✨Magic ✨: Thaumcraft, Astral Sorcery, Electroblob's wizardry

There's also botania, which is (as we all know it) a tech mod.

Q: With what does this modpack start? No tree punching?
A: One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, did-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
